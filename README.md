# Task-5_Elevate-Labs_EDA
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover patterns and factors influencing survival rates. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering (e.g., HasCabin), and visual exploration of demographic, socio-economic, and travel-related variables. Key insights highlight the impact of gender, passenger class, age, fare, and family size on survival outcomes. The findings are supported by statistical summaries, correlation heatmaps, and various univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations, providing a clear understanding of survival determinants on the Titanic.
